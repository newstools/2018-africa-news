CAPE TOWN, South Africa, May 30, 2018/APO Group/ --
                                                
                        SA Rugby confirmed on Wednesday that Pieter de Villiers has been released from his contract with the union to take up an opportunity in France.





De Villiers, a former Test prop for France, joined SA Rugby in 2012 as a consultant and served on the Springbok team management until the end of the Rugby World Cup in 2015.



He was appointed Springbok assistant coach earlier this year under Director of Rugby Rassie Erasmus, but De Villiers has requested a release from this position, and subsequently from his SA Rugby contract, due to family commitments.
