CAPE TOWN, South Africa, May 29, 2018/APO Group/ --
                                                
                        The Portfolio Committee on Communications has resolved to recommend to the National Assembly (NA) that the Minister of Communications, Ms Nomvula Mokonyane, suspends the chairperson of the Independent Communications of South Africa, Mr Rubben Mohlaloga.





The recommendation is in line with Section 8 of the Icasa Act, and is made following a guilty judgement against Mr Mohlaloga on charges of fraud and money laundering by the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crime Court.



Following the judgement in January, the committee initially took a resolution to recommend to the NA that Mr Mohlaloga be removed from the Icasa council, but the NA referred the matter back to the committee, following an intention to appeal.



The committee further resolved to fill the four board vacancies at the Media Diversity and Development Agency (Mdda). The positions will be advertised to call for public nominations.



Meanwhile, the committee was briefed by the Content Advisor and Researcher on the summary of issues raised by the labour unions during oversight visit to the SABC, in order to prepare for the meeting with the Board next week Tuesday.
