                        The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has recently concluded its Mulu Most At Risk Populations Project to combat HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia and is announcing the launch of a new follow-on project, HIV Services for Key and Priority Populations Activity.





Over the past five years, USAID’s Mulu Most At Risk Populations Project provided community-based HIV services through a network of public and private facilities, and drop-in centers that offered comprehensive and confidential HIV testing, care, and treatment reaching more than 600,000 female sex workers and individuals at high risk of contracting the HIV infection.
