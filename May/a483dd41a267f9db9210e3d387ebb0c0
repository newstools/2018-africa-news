                        The UN Conference on Trade and Development-UNCTAD's in partnership with UN Tanzania is inviting you to the press conference preceding the launch of the Economic Development in Africa Report 2018 at the International Labour Organization Conference Hall in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on Thursday 31st May, 2018.



This year's Economic Development in Africa Report-EDAR subtitled Migration and Structural Transformation in Africa will highlight how intra-African migration is of relevance for regional and continental integration and offer new insights for African governments as well as for migration stakeholders outside the continent. The report will seek to remedy knowledge gaps on the relationship between migration, economic and trade policies. By tracing patterns of intra-African migration and channels through which they affect socio-economic development outcomes in Africa, it adopts an innovative human-centered narrative in identifying opportunities for absorption of extra labour in different sectors across the continent.

Ms. Jane Muthumbi from UNCTAD Geneva will be the main presenter.  Please see draft attached programme for further details.
