CAPE TOWN, South Africa, May 30, 2018/APO Group/ --
                                                
                        The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) Chairperson, Ms Thandi Modise, has been made aware of a scam by someone going around attempting to defraud unsuspecting victims of large sums of money using her name.





Ms Modise has seen various emails, sent from an email bearing her name, requesting the receiver to transfer large sums of money – about R80 000 – to an undisclosed account number. In the emails, the writer claims that Ms Modise cannot take calls but is only available on email and promises to return the “loan” after a few days.



We urge members of the public, who receive such emails, currently sent from modiset091@gmail.com, not to respond to these fabricated requests. Parliament has referred the scam to relevant security authorities for investigation.



Several Members of Parliament in the NCOP and members of the public have confirmed receipt of this email. At least one acquaintance of Ms Modise has already fallen prey to this scam. 



It is not the first-time scams of this nature, involving Parliament’s Presiding Officers, have occurred. This happened several times during the fourth democratic Parliament – asking, on fake Parliament letterheads, for money to be deposited into fake bank accounts in the name of then Speaker of the National Assembly Mr Max Sisulu.



Anyone who has received such a letter or email is urged to come forward to assist with the investigation.
