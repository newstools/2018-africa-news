This year’s Awards Gala Dinner will be hosted at the prestigious 5-Star Langham Hotel in London, on 12th June 2018. This follows the PEA LP-GP Investor Summit, a full day event. The summit includes hosted sector-focused round-tables, lunch discussions and an open room debate session.

The PEA Awards celebrate the achievements in the African private equity market, focusing solely on the best-in-class achievements of investors and advisors in the industry.

The final winners will be selected by an independent panel of highly respected industry participants, based on selections from the London Business School Private Equity Institute and the PEA Awards Nomination Team.

The 2018 PEA Awards have received a record number of entries, the highest since the awards were launched. Based on 2017 achievements, the self-entries are complemented by editorial recommendations from the Private Equity Africa team and industry data.

Gail Mwamba, the Awards Chair and Editor of Private Equity Africa, said:

“The PEA Awards are growing from strength to strength with a record number of entries this year, the most we have received since the launch of the awards. The high quality of the entries we have received shows the industry’s resilience in continuing to deploy capital and execute world-class deals, even in challenging market conditions.”
