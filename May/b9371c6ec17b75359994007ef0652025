                            Despite the hefty challenge we are confident that we have developed and assembled a very strong squad with the relevant talent, mental strength and depth to meet those challenges
                        







The Director of Rugby and head coach of the National Team, Phil Davies, is pleased that he could get his best players available for the Gold Cup campaign except a few key players still recovering from injuries. The squad is well balanced between experience and youth and he is excited about his team’s chances in clinging their sixth consecutive Rugby Africa title.



Phil Davies explains: “We believe that home-based Namibian players provide the heartbeat of the National team, therefore we have implemented a plan in our National Academy to increase the number of quality home-based players participating in the Super Sport Rugby Challenge and the Currie Cup competitions has been a huge help in this development.”



“Namibia Rugby has introduced 25 new players at senior level over the past two years, including many of our outstanding Under 20 players through a succession plan, which now boasts over 112 players that clearly identifies the spine of our squads for RWC 2019 & 2023” Davies said.



According to Davies who is very excited about the forth-coming challenges, believe this promise to be Namibia’s toughest World Cup qualifying group of matches of the past ten years.



“Despite the hefty challenge we are confident that we have developed and assembled a very strong squad with the relevant talent, mental strength and depth to meet those challenges,” Davies said



The Gold cup kicks off with a home game against Uganda on Saturday 16 June followed by Tunisia to visit Namibia on 23 June. The first away game for the team to travel to Morocco on the 30th June. Zimbabwe follows in Buluwayo on the 4th August with the final game against Kenya in the Hage Geingob stadium on the 18th August.
