                        We all can play a crucial role in combatting pollution and preserving the environment.  



To commemorate World Environment Day on 5 June 2018, the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) in South Africa in partnership with Plastic SA are encouraging South Africans to #BeatPlasticPollution. This year’s event will take place at the CSIR in Pretoria on Tuesday, 5th of June where various environmental partners will be discussing solutions to plastic pollution and preventing marine litter for a healthier ocean and better future.
 
UN Environment, in collaboration with other partners, will support various activities happening in Gauteng from 2 – 8 June 2018 such as the Tswelopele Clean Up Campaign in Tshwane CBD with Mayor of City of Tshwane on 2nd of June 2018, Sustainability Week from 5 -7 June 2018  (more information can be found on: sustainabilityweek.co.za) and Eskom Environmental Conference from 6-7 June 2018, and this year’s theme is “Resetting the heartbeat of Environmental Management under the changing Climatic Landscape”.  
 
World Environment Day is an important day worldwide to create awareness and take action for the protection of our environment. Since 1974, it has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, widely celebrated in over 100 countries.
 
The theme for 2018 is #BeatPalsticPollution. There has been an estimated 1.1 million tons of recyclable plastic that has entered the waste stream of which 41.8% was recycled in South Africa based on input tonnages. 1.5 million tons of virgin polymer was converted into products in South Africa. We all have a responsibility to protect the environment and making a healthier planet for generations to come. We want to encourage the community to show your commitment by reducing, reusing and recycling refuse plastic.
