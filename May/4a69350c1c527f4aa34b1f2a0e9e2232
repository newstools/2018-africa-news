CAPE TOWN, South Africa, May 31, 2018/APO Group/ -- 
                                                
                        President Cyril Ramaphosa has today, 30 May 2018, met with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) at Tuynhuys, Cape Town. This meeting follows the President’s meeting with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) earlier this month and is in fulfillment of the President’s commitment to engage with all institutions supporting democracy, the so-called Chapter 9 institutions.



The IEC has used the meeting to update President Ramaphosa on preparations towards the sixth national and provincial elections, due in 2019. The meeting was attended by IEC Chairperson Mr Glen Mashinini, Deputy Chairperson Mr Terry Tselane, Chief Executive Officer Mr Sy Mamabolo and commissioners Ms Janet Love and Reverend Bongani Finca.

Sections 49 and 108 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa direct that the National Assembly and Provincial Legislatures shall have a term of five years; and that elections must be held within 90 days of the end of term. The last general elections were held on 7 May 2014.

The IEC has indicated some of the areas that need to be addressed before the next election, including amongst them outstanding boundary disputes, the tabling of the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill and the capturing of outstanding addresses on the voters’ roll.

The IEC is nevertheless confident of yet another successful, credible, free and fair election on the date to be proclaimed by the President.

President Ramaphosa is encouraged by the work being done by the IEC and calls upon all South Africans to check their voter registration details, particularly their addresses on the voters roll, to ensure that all eligible voters are able to cast their vote in the next election.
