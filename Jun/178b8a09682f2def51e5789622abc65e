PRETORIA, South Africa, June 4, 2018/APO Group/ -- 
                                                
                        There has been a campaign which seeks to destabilize social grants payments by spreading rumours that SASSA is to close all paypoints in the country without providing alternative. This misinformation has caused serious concerns in deep rural areas and Minister Susan Shabangu has requested to address House of the Traditional Leaders to set the record straight.





The media is invited to a press briefing which will be addressed by both Minsters of Social Development and COGTA immediately after the House sitting and the details are as follows:



Venue: Department of Cooperative and Traditional Affairs, 87 Hamilton Street, Pretoria 

Date: Today, 04 June 2018

Time: 12h30
