However, this has been a long-standing issue with similar incidents occurring in other countries in Africa, causing more than 1,000 deaths over the past year alone, according to media reports.

 “He condemns the resulting loss of life, property and livelihoods, as well as population displacement, which undermines peaceful coexistence between communities in many of the affected countries. It is also detrimental to regional stability,” the statement said.





 The UN chief urged all concerned governments, regional organizations, civil society and other parties to work together to find solutions to the conflicts.



 He underlined the readiness and commitment of the UN to support national and regional efforts in this regard.
