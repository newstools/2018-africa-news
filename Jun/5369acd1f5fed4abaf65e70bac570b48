FREETOWN, Sierra Leone, June 1, 2018/APO Group/ --
                                                
                        On May 30, 2018, U.S. Ambassador Maria Brewer transferred U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Excess Defense Articles (EDA) to the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces (RSLAF).



The Ambassador visited the Armed Forces Training Center (AFTC) at Benguema Barracks to welcome the RSLAF’s new recruits, present military equipment to distinguished graduates, and compliment senior leaders for their focus on the recruitment of more female soldiers. Of the 522 recruits, 100 of them are female. This laudable feat is the result of targeted recruitment focused on diversifying the force. The Office of Security Cooperation (OSC) has sought out equipment, such as field gear, combat boots and uniforms, computers, radios, tent sets, and industrial sewing machines, which will enhance the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces’ (RSLAF) operational effectiveness and bolster communications inter-operability across the mission. EDA is one of a number of programs DoD uses to facilitate the transfer of equipment to friendly partners to further U.S. national security and foreign policy goals. The combined efforts of Sierra Leone and the U.S. are building a more professional, inclusive force capable of responding to dynamic challenges of the future.
