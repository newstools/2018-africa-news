This year’s honour is around the theme of “the future of transport and trade”. Tying in with the World Congress focus on “innovation on the move”, the piece must offer valuable insights into the road transport industry’s future and ideally link this to the wider context of geopolitical developments, trade and technological innovation. It should appeal to a global audience.

The competition is open to all journalists across the globe from the international and regional media, who publish or broadcast original reports.

The winner will be offered free registration to the IRU World Congress (www.IRUworldCongress.com) in Muscat, Oman, with hotel and flights included.

The piece or broadcast will be promoted on the IRU website and dedicated World Congress website and the journalist will be invited to give a short presentation on reception of the award at the event.
