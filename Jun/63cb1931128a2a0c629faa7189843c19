                        The Zambia High Commission in London wishes to warn the public that there is a scam in which unsuspecting individuals are being offered employment contracts by a named multilateral corporation with operations in the United Kingdom.





The jobs were posted in March 2018 on jobwebzambia website for various job positions.



The applicants are being asked to pay £740 for their Permit through a Visa Processing Directorate and asked to send the money via International Money Transfer (MoneyGram or Western Union Money Transfer). 



The Mission verified with the named multilateral corperation who confirmed having no knowledge of such employment opportunities but are investigating the scam.



In this regard, the Mission wishes to advise citizens to verify such employment offers with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Zambia.  



This Press Statement has been necessitated by the increasing number of Zambians who are falling prey to this scam.
