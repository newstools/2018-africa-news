                            The Director of Khora Africa Projects Co-operative Limited, a Tshwane-based food and beverage company that produces fruit jam, chutney, chilli sauce and atchaar, Mr Thadishe Phoku says that their main target is to establish a new market and potential distribution channels for exporting goods and services to Mozambique.



Khora Africa Projects Co-operative Limited which is currently based at the Ekangala Industrial Park is one of the twenty-three local companies assisted by the Department of Trade and Industry (the dti) to promote local products and services at the South African Pavilion that will be hosted during the 54th Feira International de Maputo (FACIM) Trade Fair in Maputo, Mozambique from 27 August-3 September 2018.



“This is an enormous opportunity for us emerging exporters if our humble beginning from a home and kitchen setup in 2002 until 2013 when we were struggling for financial backing is anything to go by. Today here we are lauding the dti for inspiring confidence through their incentive schemes,” said Phoku



the dti through the Export Marketing and Investment (EMIA) Scheme offers financial and non-financial support to small, medium and micro-sized enterprises (SMMEs) to access global markets.
                                We first need to establish our fully equipped production facility and acquire a farm to produce raw materials from
                            



“The department has assisted us to acquire industrial equipment and the EMIA   Scheme will ensure that our products are exposed to new export markets. We have also recently secured a grant from the dti’s Agro-processing Support Scheme (APSS) to beef up our equipment and transport needs,” he cited



On future aspirations, Phoku said they would like to expand their business footprint regionally and internationally.



“We first need to establish our fully equipped production facility and acquire a farm to produce raw materials from. We also aspire to establish markets in other African countries and overseas,” he concluded



FACIM ranks as the biggest trade show in Mozambique visited by more than 500 companies from 20 countries. It caters for a variety of products and services and attracts the attention of companies from the world over.
