TRIPOLI, Libya, August 30, 2018/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The UN Support Mission in Libya condemns the escalation of violence in the Greater Tripoli area, now in its third day and call for an immediate ceasefire on all fronts.





The Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) in Libya, Dr. Ghassan Salame, has reached out to the concerned Libyan parties to immediately cease all hostilities, resume ceasefire talks and find longer term solutions to ensure the safety and security of the capital, its institutions and its residents.Â 



The SRSG has also been in contact with UN Security Council members, as well as regional and international actors with influence on Libyan parties to push for calm, call for the end the military mobilization and come to the negotiating table.



In his meeting with President Fayez Sarraj in Tripoli, Dr. Salame affirmed the need for the Government of National Accord to assume its full responsibility in addressing critical security and economic challenges.



The Mission has been following up on the humanitarian situation in the affected areas and providing support, where possible. UNSMIL reminds all parties of their duty to protect civilians, in accordance with international humanitarian and human rights law. The Mission condemns violence in all its form; it has no justification.



UNSMIL reaffirms its commitment to Libya and will continue to work across the country to support Libyans on their path to a unified, stable and functioning state.
