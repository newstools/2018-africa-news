PRETORIA, South Africa, August 29, 2018/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The work of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) begins with people’s needs and ends with public’s feedback on their experiences of service delivery. This was a view expressed by a leader of the delegation visiting a number of healthcare facilities in Botshabelo - Mangaung Metropolitan Munipality, Ms Tsapane Kwedi Mampuru, as part of the NCOP’s Taking Parliament to the People Campaign (TPTTP) in the Free State. Ms Mampuru’s group received a briefing on progress made since the 2017 NCOP visit at Botshabelo hospital and visited three health facilities which are Harry Gwala Clinic, Itumeleng Community Health Centre and Jazzman Mokghothu Psychiatric Clinic yesterday.  

 Ms Mampuru’s delegation is one of eight groups of MP’s, Members of the Free State Provincial Legislature, SALGA and local municipalities visiting numerous service delivery sites in the Mangaung Metropolitan and Xhariep District Municipalities, as part of the NCOP’s report back on their August 2017 visit. The NCOP delegation was briefed on the employment of 169 administrative staff to be deployed in various health facilities to relieve healthcare professionals of administrative duties. Also appreciated by Members of Parliament was the procurement of over 60 additional ambulances and the establishment of three additional emergency control centres to reduce the waiting period for ambulance services.

 Ms Mampuru said the 16-year-old flagship TPTTP programme of the NCOP continues to register the desired impact on people’s lives.

 The groups of Parliamentarians sent to various municipal areas in Mangaung and Xhariep, are visiting numerous services delivery sites and would wrap up the visit with six public hearings where a consolidated report of the NCOP will be given to people on progress made since the August 2017 TPTTP programme.
