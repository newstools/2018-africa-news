PRETORIA, South Africa, August 16, 2018/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The South African Government was deeply saddened to hear of the tragic passing-on of 5 Jordanian security officials on 11 August 2018, following a suicide bomb attack in the Jordanian town of Fuheis.



The blast is believed to have targeted the annual Fuheis festival, a prominently Christian gathering that is mainly attended by families. In follow-up action, the Jordan police and security forces surrounded a house in the nearby town of Salt containing ISIS/Daâ€™esh suspects and in the ensuing shootout, three terrorists and four security officers were killed.

South Africa condemns in the strongest possible tone the continued targeting of civilians by terrorist organisations and further calls for the cessation of hostilities by terrorist organisations in the region.



The thoughts and prayers of the South African people remain with the people of Jordan and with the families of the fallen security officials who bravely sacrificed their lives.
