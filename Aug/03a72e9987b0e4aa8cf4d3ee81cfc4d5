PRETORIA, South Africa, August 21, 2018/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The Presiding Officers of Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, Speaker Baleka Mbete and Chairperson Thandi Modise, have expressed a deep sense of sadness following the passing on of former UN Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan today.





Speaker Mbete and Chairperson Modise say South Africa, Africa and the world are poorer after losing a luminary son of the African soil, who through his character and its manifestation in various facets of life, not only served but inspired humanity across the world. Mr Annan was a distinguished international statesman, champion of peace, an advocate for universal human right and indefatigable crusader for social justice. 



He had a special place in his heart for South Africa and keen interest in its developmental trajectory. He had called on South Africa to assert its role as a world leader in so many respects. We dare not fail. 



Addressing the special joint sitting of Parliament in March 2006, Mr Annan called for unity, peace and development as means to deal with mountains of human misery still facing millions of people in South Africa and in the continent. In this regard, one of the meaningful ways to celebrate the outstanding life of this illustrious son of Africa is to double our efforts in resolving the human miseries facing the nations of the world. We must intensify our resolve to break the legacy of slavery and apartheid, by effectively reversing the current trends of poverty, inequality, unemployment and violence against women and children.



As a part of the collective of eminent persons formed by our founding democratic President Nelson Mandela , The Elders, he remained the point of reference, a voice of reason and a guiding light on human development, peace and unity.



Parliament will continue to celebrate the contribution of this great African and world leader.
