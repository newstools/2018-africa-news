PRETORIA, South Africa, August 15, 2018/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) is aware of the case of a distressed citizen reported by Mr Baise on Sunday, 12 August 2018. By Monday, 13 August 2018, our Embassy in Berlin made direct contact with him.





The news report gives the impression that DIRCO has not attended to the matter.



The following information is thus worth taking into account:



a. The statement by Mr Baise published by Traveller24 is misleading as it implies that DIRCO has not attended to the complaint.



b. DIRCO: Consular Services is fully aware of the tragic incident and immediately assisted Mr Baise when the matter came to our attention.



c. Mr Baise has been in direct contact with our Consular Services and the Embassy in Berlin since Monday, 13 August 2018.



The embassy is in contact with the hospital. Once Ms Crossley is fit to travel, the Embassy will assist with the issuance of emergency travel documents.
