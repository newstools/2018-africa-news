Government created export councils to improve communication and co-operation within different industrial sectors in terms of strategies for penetrating international markets. Export councils are an integral part of government's plan to grow exports, diversify product offerings, broaden markets and develop exporters through the mobilisation of black-, women- and youth-owned enterprises, as well as emerging exporters.

According to October, the purpose of the meeting between the department and export councils is to create a platform for a common path towards positioning South Africa as a reliable partner internationally while promoting the competitiveness of South African companies to explore and exploit targeted markets.



“The meeting will also be used as a platform to cultivate a common vision and programme of action for the department to engage directly with industry on how common goals, objectives and targets can be efficiently and effectively achieved,” says October.



He adds that the engagement session will also afford the department and export councils the opportunity to jointly encourage industries to work with the dti to grow exports, share challenges, opportunities and develop solutions.



Currently, eighteen export councils are registered with the dti, covering the following sectors: automotive, metal fabrication, steel, capital equipment and rail transport, leather and footwear, electro-technical, built environment professions, agro-processing and cosmetics. These entities are funded by the dti through the Sector-Specific Assistance Scheme (SSAS) under the Export Marketing and Investment Assistance (EMIA) Scheme.
