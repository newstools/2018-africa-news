                            The almost decade long Boko Haram insurgency has had a devastating impact on communities in countries within the Lake Chad Basin. On the recommendation of the First Conference on Regional Stabilization Strategy for the areas affected by Boko Haram insurgency that held in November 2017 in N’Djamena, Chad, a Regional Stabilisation, Resilience and Recovery strategy has been developed. The strategy reflects the different levels of engagement, from community to regional, that will be critical in efforts aimed at pursuing the goal of stabilizing the region that has witnessed a crisis of global magnitude.





The Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) and the African (AU), supported by UNDP through funding support from the Government of Germany, will host a Ministerial conference which will lead to the adoption of the Regional Stabilisation Strategy. The Minister’s Conference will be attended by up to ten ministers, who are the 1st and 2nd Commissioners of LCBC member states from Members States. They will be joined by;



H.E. Kashim Shettima, Executive Governor of Borno State and Chair of LCB Governors’ Forum
Amb. Nuhu Mamman, the Executive Secretary, Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC)
Hon. Suleiman Hussein Adamu, Minister of Water Resources, Federal Republic of Nigeria,
Mr. Edward Kallon, UN Res. Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative  
H.E. Dr. Bernhard Schlagheck, German Ambassador to Nigeria



Time:  09:00AM

Venue: Sheraton Hotel, Ladi Kwali Conference Centre, Ball Room 3



Once adopted the document will be the framework for implementing initiatives for stabilizing Boko Haram affected Communities in the Lake Chad Basin.
