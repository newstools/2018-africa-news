PRETORIA, South Africa, August 14, 2018/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services Chairperson, Dr Mathole Motshekga, is pleased with the announcement of Dr Silas Ramaite as the acting National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP).


Dr Motshekga said the speed with which President Cyril Ramaphosa acted to make the appointment is commendable. “This is clearly what was needed: a fast response to ensure stability and integrity to a critical institution.”

Dr Motshekga further expressed confidence in Dr Ramaite’s ability to head the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). “He holds several law degrees. He is a career prosecutor. This is also not the first time he finds himself acting in the position, which makes him familiar with the role.” Dr Ramaite was acting NDPP following Adv Mxolisi Nxasana’s removal from the role in 2015 and also following the resignation of Adv Bulelani Ngcuka in 2004.
 
Dr Ramaite’s appointment comes a day after the Constitutional Court ruled the appointment of Adv Shaun Abrahams to be invalid.

Dr Motshekga said the committee will give the necessary support to Dr Ramaite to ensure the smooth running of the NPA.
