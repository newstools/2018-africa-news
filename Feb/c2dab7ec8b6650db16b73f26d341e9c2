                        A 19-7 win over Standard Chartered Impala Saracens saw Menengai Cream Homeboyz win their second consecutive title as the second round of the KRU Women’s 10-a-side festival (KRU.co.ke) took place at the KCB Sports Club in Ruaraka, Nairobi on Sunday 18 February 2018.



Janet Owino scored and converted Homeboyz first try for a 7-0 lead that they took into the breather. Linet Moraa struck a second half brace with Owino managing a solitary conversion to give Homeboyz a healthy 19-0 lead. Judith Auma would land a late consolation try for Impala, her efforts a tad too late as Homeboyz followed up on the victory at the opening round at USIU with another cup title victory.

Mwamba, beaten finalists at USIU on Sunday 4 February, finished third at Ruaraka with a 14-5 victory over Northern Suburbs 14-5 in the Comras beat Kenyatta University Ladies 26-0 in the fifth place Ranking final as Top Fry Nakuru registered a similar 26-0 score over Shamas to finish seventh overall.
