Why plast & printpack alger is growing so fast: Algeria’s plastics industry is the fastest growing on the African continent

The Country Cluster of EUROMAP-European Plastics and Rubber Machinery confirms significant double-digit growth for the Maghreb countries Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia as well as West African countries such as Nigeria.

The per capita consumption of plastics in Algeria has grown by about 9% annually over the past ten years, from 10.0 kg in 2007 to 23.1 kg in 2017 and is estimated to be 25.8 kg in 2020. The country's plastic consumption has grown by 11% annually over the same period. It has almost tripled from 338 kt to 955 kt. An increase to 1,121 kt is expected by 2020.

Algeria is Africa’s largest importer of plastics in primary forms

As all plastic raw materials are imported (mainly from the Middle East, Asia and Europe) with the exception of 3%, the Algerian market has great potential for exporters.

Imports of plastic raw materials, for instance, grew by 13% annually between 2007 and 2015, from 304 kt to 817 kt, +169%!

Imports of plastic raw materials from other countries have developed as follows:


	Morocco: from 374 kt in 2007 to 421 kt in 2015, +12.5%
	Tunisia: from 209 kt in 2007 to 286 kt in 2015, +36.8%
	Nigeria: from 513 kt in 2007 to 754 kt in 2015, +47.0%
