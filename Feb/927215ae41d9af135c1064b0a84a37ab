CAPE TOWN, South Africa, February 16, 2018/APO Group/ --
                                                
                        The Department of Science and Technology (DST) will launch the second edition of the South African Risk and Vulnerability Atlas (SARVA) with critical information on the impact of climate change in South Africa.





Developed by the DST entity, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the atlas presents findings of current research on the risk and vulnerability of key social and economic sectors to climate change and emphasises the need for proactive disaster management.



Like many nations across the globe, South Africa is facing devastating effects due to climate change. Provinces like the Western Cape are experiencing one of its worst droughts in decades, while the Free State and Northern Cape have suffered substantial depletion of livestock as well as crop failure due to persistent drought conditions.



A recent report by the World Economic Forum states the need for coordinated action to mitigate and adapt to climate change, which threatens local and global economies. Action plans will also have to develop priorities such as social equality, public health as well as food, water and energy security. 



Members of the media are invited to the launch:

Date: Wednesday, 21 February 2018

Time: 10:30 for 11:00 – 13:00

Venue: Dalasi, the Crowne Plaza, Rosebank Hotel, 10 Tyrwhitt Avenue, Rosebank, Johannesburg



Copies of the Atlas will be available at the launch
