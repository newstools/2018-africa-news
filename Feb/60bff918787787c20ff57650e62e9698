The issues:  

Trade facilitation has made a big difference to competitiveness in the East African region. Between 2010 and 2017, significant efficiency gains have been achieved at the ports and borders, and by revenue authorities as well as agencies and firms involved in trade logistics.

TMEA, her partners and others have played an important role in these achievements. Valuable lessons have been learnt. The objective of the East African Trade Development Forum is to showcase the exciting results we have achieved with our partners during our Strategy One (2010-2017), share lessons learnt, and discuss Strategy 2 (2018-2024).
