Get Into Rugby Zambia Project Manager Tom Chaloba reviewed that the game was growing in leaps and bounds across the Country. "We have seen significant progress being made by all our District and Provincial Coordinators in as far as the women's game is concerned".

"Provinces such as Southern, Eastern, Western and Northern have for the first time startedÂ  logging in reports of Tag and Touch Rugby games being played in some schools and communal set ups, to us at the Union, we are keenly following such news with the interest it demands" Chaloba said.

Zambia Rugby Union President Gen Clement Sinkamba also reaffirmed his Executive's commitment to the wholesome growth of rugby by both genders in Zambia. "We have taken deliberate steps to ensure girls have a platform on which they can showcase their skills and talents by firstly, increasing the number of games they play each year at local, regional and international levels, and secondly by identifying role models for them to look up to in their careers. We are glad to see our efforts bearing expected fruits ,albeit, too early to say so" Sinkamba concluded.
