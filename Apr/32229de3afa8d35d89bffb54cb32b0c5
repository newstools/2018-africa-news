“The objective of the review is to identify critical areas of the SACU Agreement to be amended to facilitate the transformation of SACU into a "development integration arrangement," said Davies. He emphasised that SACU has already identified the critical pillars to advance this objective through the six-point plan.



The pillars of the six-point plan include: industrialisation; trade facilitation; a unified approach to trade negotiations with third parties; establishment of institutions; trade in services and the review of the revenue-sharing arrangement to facilitate the implementation of cross-border projects that promote regional integration.



The review of the 2002 SACU agreement aims to facilitate the implementation of the agreed work programme” said Davies. The implementation of the six-point plan is central in promoting sustainable development of SACU economies.
