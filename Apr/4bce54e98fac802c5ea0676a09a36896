Hosted at the John Kani Theatre, the event will honour and celebrate both South Africa’s past and current legends with a compilation called, ‘Re go rwesha dipalakata’ - A Song for our Legends which will be a melting pot of the works that were created by Jonas Gwangwa; Fred Hagemann; Prof. Keorapetse Kgositsile; Abigail Kubeka; Joseph Louw; Peter Magubane; Miriam Makeba; Dorothy Masuka; Don Matera; Todd Matshikiza; Miriam Tladi; Dolly Rathebe; Caiphus Semenya and Adam Small. A piece of the works of each of these Legends selected from the body of work that they created over many years is included in the production.



This night of the Legends compilation is a mixture of music, song, spoken word and dance complemented by projection and photography. The Legends selected for this piece and their works is interwoven by various vignettes and montages that flow seamlessly from one to the next in logical sequence to provide an entertaining 90 minutes performance piece.



Prior to the Legends Tribute, Minister Mthethwa will also launch the Living Legends Legacy Trust Endowment Fund.
