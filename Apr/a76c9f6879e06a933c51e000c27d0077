Mr Burt said:

"The UK is a strong partner and friend of Libya. I look forward to continuing our closework on security, counter terrorism, reforming the economy and trade. I appreciated the opportunity to discuss complex migration issues and also matters relating to the legacy of years of terrorism."

"Helping Libyans to break the political deadlock and build strong state institutions is in Britain’s interests because this is the only way to help Libya re-establish control over its own borders and defeat terrorism for good."

This visit was the final stage of a three country trip that also included Paris for the Lebanon CEDRE donor conference and Tunisia.
