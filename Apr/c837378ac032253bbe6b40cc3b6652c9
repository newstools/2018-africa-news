“He crafted the Ethos of Batho Pele. He lived them and insisted that the public service is professional and all public servants serve the people with the same commitments and dedication. He also extended his professionalism and commitment to the diplomatic family when he was appointed High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Ireland, young people learnt a lot from him”, said Sisulu.
