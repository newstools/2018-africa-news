                        Protecting the human rights of people most vulnerable to HIV is essential to advance efforts to end the AIDS epidemic. However, stigma, discrimination and other human rights violations continue to prevent access to essential HIV services.



The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR), a mechanism of the African Union, has a broad mandate to promote and protect human rights. As part of its work the ACHPR undertook a three-year study on HIV and human rights in Africa which was on adopted in November 2017.  

The report on this study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the progress and challenges relating to human rights in the response to HIV in Africa. It shares best practices on the continent and calls for renewed action by States, civil society and others to advance human rights as central to ending AIDS.
