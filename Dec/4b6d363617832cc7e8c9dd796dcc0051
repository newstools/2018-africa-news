It offers a framework for promoting safe, orderly and regular migration that will assist in tackling challenges in the management of international migration. For South Africa, it is encouraging that the UN Global Compact will among other objectives encourage regular pathways to enable regular migration. South Africa is among the top countries on the African continent receiving the highest numbers of asylum seekers and economic migrants. The country is already working towards the envisaged integrated, secure and coordinated border management.
