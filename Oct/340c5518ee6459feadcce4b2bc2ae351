The Plenipotentiary Conference is the highest decision-making body of ITU, the United Nations specialized agency for information and communications technology (ICT). The conference is the key event at which ITU member states build consensus on key international ICT issues, elect leaders for top posts, and decide on a roadmap for the ITU’s work over the next four years, including strategic and financial plans.
