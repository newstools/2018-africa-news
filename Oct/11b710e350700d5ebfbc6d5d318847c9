This seminar examines the impact of population trends and risk factors for political instability on Africa’s long-term future. The first session looks at how African states can achieve a demographic dividend that would accelerate improve livelihoods. With its young population, Africa has tremendous demographic potential but population growth is too high and economic growth too low to rapidly reduce poverty or improve average income.

The second session discusses the structural pressures that increase the risk of political instability and violent conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding these pressures is key for conflict prevention, development and peacebuilding.

The ISS reports will be available at the seminar.
