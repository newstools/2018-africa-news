CAPE TOWN, South Africa, October 2, 2018/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            Deputy President David Mabuza will host French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on an Official Visit to South Africa on 04 and 05 October 2018. This will be the first Official Visit which Deputy President Mabuza hosts since taking office, and the French Prime Minister's first visit to South Africa.





The visit follows a bilateral meeting between President Cyril Ramaphosa and President Emmanuel Macron during the G7 Leaders' Summit Outreach under the theme 'Healthy, productive and resilient oceans and seas, coasts and communities', in Québec City, Canada, in June 2018.



The Official Visit by Prime Minister Philippe builds on the outcomes of the South Africa-France Forum of Political Dialogue which took place in Paris on 22 March 2018, as well as on the country's participation in the VivaTech 2018 in which a number of South African innovation and digital startups participated in France in May 2018.



During the visit, several bilateral agreements will be concluded, focusing on cooperation in the fields of education and training, science and technology as well as on environmental cooperation. As Chairperson of the Human Resource Development Council (HRDC), education and training are areas of particular importance to the Deputy President.



In line with the Nelson Mandela Centenary Celebrations this year, Prime Minister Philippe is expected to hand over the restored and digitized Rivonia Trail dictabelts, which France has been assisting South Africa in restoring, and at the same time building South African personnel capacity in digital restoration and archiving.



Deputy President Mabuza and his counterpart Prime Minister Philippe will also participate at the South African - French Business Forum which will be attended by various captains of industries focussing in areas such as energy, science and technology, agriculture, manufacturing, transport, water and sanitation amongst others.



Deputy President Mabuza will be supported by Cabinet Ministers and senior government officials.
