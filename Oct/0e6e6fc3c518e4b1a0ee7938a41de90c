The State of the World’s Volunteerism Report 2018 (SWVR) places a spotlight on the relationship between resilient communities and volunteerism, finding that volunteers are a core strategy in building resilient communities.

High level representatives of the League of Arab States, the Egyptian Government, and several UN Agencies will have a discussion with UNV and one of the 2018 SWVR authors on the following key findings:




	Local volunteerism creates new opportunities for women and youth in Arab States, by giving them a voice and a space for civic participation.
	Local volunteerism can be a valuable tool for refugee management and relationship-building between host and refugee communities in Arab States.
	Local volunteerism can provide a valuable resource for the implementation of the 2030 SDGs in Arab States, by connecting official actors with unofficial efforts.
