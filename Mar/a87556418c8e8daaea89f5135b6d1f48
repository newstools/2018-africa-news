                        Kenya finished seventh overall at the USA Sevens after series of battling performances throughout the three days of competition at a tournament that served as the fifth round of the 2017/18 HSBC Sevens World Series.





Shujaa started their campaign on a losing note, going down 14-19 to France in their opening Pool A match on Saturday morning. It took the experience of Collins Injera to score two tries in the ensuing 19-12 win over Russia, a match that left the team needing a win over fancied Fiji to reach the cup quarterfinals. They pulled it off, the experienced trio of Injera, Willy Ambaka and Andrew Amonde each scoring in the 17-14 victory over Fiji. This result saw Shujaa earned the right to face eventual cup finalists Argentina in the cup quarters. They however fell to a 12-17 defeat.



Playing in the fifth place semifinal against Australia, Shujaa gave as good as they got, finally exiting the tournament following a 26-21 sudden death defeat after the two sides had been tied 21-21 at the close of regulation time.
