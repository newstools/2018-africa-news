This is the first such event organized by the United States in almost four years. Representatives from American companies such as Bechtel, Caterpillar, G.E., G.E. Health, Whispering Bell, and Hill International attended the event in Tunis. In addition, two trade organizations representing many U.S. firms participated in the event, including the American Chamber of Commerce in Libya based in Tripoli, and the U.S. Libya-Business Association, based in Washington, D.C.
